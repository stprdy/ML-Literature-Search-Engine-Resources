# ML-Literature-Search-Engine-Resources

## Introduction
This repository is part of a project aimed at creating a specialised search engine for academic machine learning literature. It will serve as a collection point for relevant academic papers divided across various subfields of machine learning.

## Document Collection Goals

**Scope**: Must fit within our defined machine learning subfields.
 **Peer Review**: Only peer-reviewed papers from reputable sources.
 **Recency**: Published within the last 5 years; seminal works can be older.
 **Citations**: Preferably high citation count indicating impact.
 **Accessibility**: Full texts should be publicly accessible or available through common academic subscriptions.
- **Diversity**: A mix of authors, institutions, and geographies.
- **Methodology**: Clear, rigorous, and well-documented research methods.
- **Innovation**: Contributions that offer new insights or methods are prioritized.
- **Language**: English, or include an English summary if foundational.
